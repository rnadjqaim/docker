* we isolate services in os of vm,vms/instances  will be overprovisioned (if we need 5g we put 7 gb ) 
  more cost, is not good for business, high capex and opex, mainanance 
  * vm is expensive 
  1. os need nurturing, need licensing, take time to boot
  ---------------------------------------
  Isolation without os : multiple services running in same os but isolated.
    
  
  * containers : proccess[isolated]
  * virualization is not containerization 
  * vm need os but container is not need os 
  * containers uses host os for compute resources 
  * 
  #--------------------------------------------------------
  docker actually manages your containers 
  - we can run container without docker, by have create hold directory, cgroup, dependency
  - docker history :
